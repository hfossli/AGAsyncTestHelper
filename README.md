# AGAsyncTestHelper

C Macro for writing unit tests with asynchronous operations. Works perfectly with SenTestingKit!

### Example blocks

    - (void)testDoSomeOperation
    {
        __block BOOL jobDone = NO;
    
        [Manager doSomeOperationOnDone:^(id data) {
            jobDone = YES; 
        }];
    
        WAIT_WHILE(!jobDone, 2.0);
    }

`WAIT_WHILE()` will stall current runloop while `!jobDone` is `TRUE` and throw an `STFail` if exceeding time limit (2.0 seconds)


### Example plain callback / delegate

    - (void)testDoSomeOperation
    {
        [Manager doSomeOperationOnDoneTellTarget:self selector:@selector(someOperationDone)];
    
        WAIT_WHILE(!self.jobDone, 2.0);
    }
    
    - (void)someOperationDone
    {
        self.jobDone = YES;
    }

`WAIT_WHILE()` will stall current runloop while `!self.jobDone` is `TRUE` and throw an `STFail` if exceeding time limit (2.0 seconds)

### Advantages

- Minimum code
- Error thrown *in the test*. Since it is based on macro's the exception will not be thrown in some 3rd party implementation file further down the stack
- Small library
- Works perfectly with SenTestingKit
- No known bugs or issues

### Overview

The macro will evaluate the expression while the expression is true **or** the time limit is reached.

These macros will generate STFail() if time limit is reached.
     
    WAIT_WHILE(expressionIsTrue, limitInSeconds)
    WAIT_WHILE_WITH_DESC(expressionIsTrue, seconds, description, ...)
    WAIT_WHILE_EQUALS(value1, value2, limitInSeconds)
    WAIT_WHILE_EQUALS_WITH_DESC(value1, value2, limitInSeconds, description, ...)
    WAIT_WHILE_EQUALS_WITH_ACCURACY(value1, value2, accuracy, limitInSeconds)
    WAIT_WHILE_EQUALS_WITH_ACCURACY_WITH_DESC(value1, value2, accuracy, limitInSeconds, description, ...)
    WAIT_WHILE_NOT_EQUALS(value, value2, limitInSeconds)
    WAIT_WHILE_NOT_EQUALS_WITH_DESC(value1, value2, limitInSeconds, description, ...)
    AG_STALL_RUNLOPP_WHILE(expressionIsTrue, limitInSeconds)

### Extensive description

This library or bundle enables you to do async test operations with asynchronous callbacks in your SenTestCase. Works with GCD (Grand Central Dispatch) and regular delegate callbacks. 

### Cocoa pods
    
It's available as `AGAsyncTestHelper`.
